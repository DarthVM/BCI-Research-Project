# BCI-Research-Project
A model of Brain-Computer Interface for University's small research project. It reads data (Amplitude of each recording device, in microvolts) of Electroencephallogram (result of brain activity) and displays information on the screen. Additionally, the program evaluate the Fourier Transform to show the spectral analysis (for understanding the rhythm of the brain).

The graphics (charts. etc.) was written in Qt5 library.
The mathematics was written in Armadillo library
