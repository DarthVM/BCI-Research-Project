# BCI-Research-Project
A model of Brain-Computer Interface for University's small research project. It reads data (Amplitude of each recording device, in microVolts) of Electroencephallogram (result of a brain activity) and displays information on the screen. Additionally, the program evaluate the Fourier Transformation to show the spectral analysis (for understanding the rhythm of the brain).

The graphics (charts, etc.) was written using Qt5 libraries.
The mathematics was written using "Armadillo" library
